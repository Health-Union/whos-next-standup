# Who's Next? 
The standup manager.

_Who's Next_ allows you to figure out who goes next (Randomly) and limit times. 

## To Use:
1. fill out the memebers.yml file with names and image urls of your team.
2. Run the script:

```
python3 ./whos_next.py
```

3. When prompted you can either:
* press `return` to advance to the next member OR
* type `countdown` to have _who's next_ advance through your standup with time limits.

4. When you are all done (or everyone has gone) you can exit by typing `exit`.
